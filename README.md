# Medical Data History – SQL Analysis Project

This repository contains a **hands-on SQL project** completed during my **Data Analytics Internship at DataMites**.  
The project focuses on analyzing medical patient and admission data to solve real-world analytical problems using SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze structured healthcare data to uncover insights related to:
- Patient demographics
- Admission patterns
- Diagnosis trends
- Geographic distribution
- Healthcare-related metrics

All analysis was performed using **SQL queries on relational databases**, simulating real analytics and reporting tasks.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL / MySQL**
- **Relational Databases**
- **Joins (INNER, LEFT)**
- **Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN)**
- **Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN)**
- **Date Functions (YEAR, DAY, BETWEEN)**
- **String Functions (CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, LIKE)**
- **GROUP BY & HAVING**
- **UNION & Subqueries**

---

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The analysis is performed using the following tables:
- `patients`
- `admissions`
- `doctors`
- `province_names`

These tables are joined where necessary to answer complex analytical questions.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions Solved
- Gender-wise and age-wise patient distribution  
- Patients with specific diagnoses and repeat admissions  
- City and province-level patient concentration  
- Admission trends by day and year  
- Identification of obesity using BMI calculation  
- Doctor specialty analysis for diagnosis-specific patients  
- Allergy frequency and popularity analysis  

---

## 📊 Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated
✔ Data filtering and cleansing (NULL handling)  
✔ Multi-table joins and relational mapping  
✔ Aggregation and grouping for trend analysis  
✔ String and date manipulation  
✔ Writing readable and optimized SQL queries  
✔ Applying real-world business logic in SQL
